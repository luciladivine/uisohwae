I was at a town festival/carnival with my children (6amp7 y/o at the time). My brother and my mother don't get along well. As they both think they are better than everyone else and are never wrong.

So backstory I’m a server at an upscale Japanese hibachi restaurant, which means the chefs cook on the table in front of the customers. On the weekends, all the servers usually have 2 tables at a time, which each table has 8 people so it can be a lot to deal with. Well I was incredibly busy already, and I had an elderly couple at one of the tables. They were incredibly rude and needy the entire time but oh well, it happens. Well the rest of their table leaves, and they just stay there not saying. Оптимизируйте работу iPhone, iPad или iPod, очистив их от 'мусора'.

HELL LAST WEEK Much to the contrary of numerous classic depictions, Hell was not an endless cavern of fire and brimstone. There were no sinners being flayed by demons. There weren't any scorching lakes of sulphur. There was even a distinct lack of grisly torture devices. Hell was an infinite shroud of thick, grey mist. A constant cold aura of dread and confusion. An endless anticipation for something awful to happen, much like a contestant who kept promising to submit even though.

I love Ru, but some things about ha grinds my gears. I listened to the newest episode of WTT and I got something to say: Stop biting the hands that feed you. The reason his career exploded again for the second time is because of young people. He needs to stop talking about how young people are the root of all evil. We're not.

I've got something a little different for this one, kind of inspired by how The AV Club has this feature where they have a setlist and bands stop in, choose a song, and do a cover of it. I've assembled a setlist of songs, new and old (you'll notice some familiars in there), for you to choose from and use in your creation. I'm hoping this will attract some new folks into the game as some of these tunes are ready-buil.
